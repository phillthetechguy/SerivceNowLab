<h1>ServiceNow Home Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of me setting up a developer instance in ServiceNow to practice receiving, assigning, updating and resolving tickets. I have used a common troubleshooting issue to simulate a real world scenario such as "user not able to receive emails" while also keeping work notes updated and ensuring everything is properly documented. This documents every step i took from start to finish and each step i took in creating and resolving this ticket.
<br />


<h2>Services Used</h2>

- <b>ServiceNow</b> 


<h2>Video walk-through:</h2>

Below is the video of me walking through the lifecycle of a ticket while also updating it to our knowledge base for future issues:

This what the main overview screen should look like:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
From there we would go to incident and create a new ticket since one isn't assigned:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
When creating the ticket we would fill out the required fields and hit submit to submit new ticket:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that it's created open the incident (would be in contact with user at this point) and update notes while fixing issue :  <br/>

<br />
Once issue is resolved, to close ticket set state to resolved and add resolution notes then hit resolve button:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once resolved to close out ticket, reopen the incident and hit the close incident button :  <br/>
